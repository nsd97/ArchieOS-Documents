**ArchieOS**

AI Operating System for Real Estate Teams

---

Archie is an AI operating system that turns a realtor's voice memos into a fully handled transaction: listings drafted, contracts prepared, tasks distributed, reminders set, and follow ups queued, with a human grade safety layer on top.

## Problem

Salesforce, HubSpot and every real estate crm were built for a different era. They are databases with workflows bolted on, optimized for admins, not for the person in the car racing between showings. They keep trying to bolt AI onto that old chassis. **It is like dropping a Ferrari engine into a twenty year old Honda. The frame wasn't built for it.**

Real estate agents, especially top producers, are the stress test for any sales system that claims to automate work. They are often non technical, always on the move, juggling a thousand tiny things, and they hate CRMs. If you can build an interface simple enough for an ex stripper/bartender driving a Mercedes at highway speed while negotiating a million dollar deal, you have not just built a tool for realtors. You have built the future of sales software for everyone.

For top teams the pain is not lack of leads. It is death by a thousand cuts: endless admin, fragmented tools, and overworked human assistants who are hard to hire and often underperforming.

## Market

3M+ active real estate agents in North America. The top 20% do most of the volume but drown in operations.

## Voice Memo to Done

A realtor just hung up a call with a seller while sitting in the car.

1. They open Archie and speak for 30 to 60 seconds, exactly as they would in a raw voice memo.
2. Archie transcribes, understands who this is about, and infers what needs to happen.
3. Within seconds the app shows:
    - New listing draft process started.
    - Tasks for staging in progress.
    - Photographer outreach in progress.
    - Seller update email drafted.
    - Client data collection form ready to be sent.
4. Safe actions auto execute. Others appear under Drafts waiting for tap to approve, edit or reject.
5. The realtor manages everything with large, Kindergarten level controls: big Yes, No, Edit buttons, nothing dense or technical.

## Target Customer

Team leaders of North American real estate teams with 5-25 agents doing 50-300 transactions per year who either employ an admin or are on the verge of needing one.

## Business Model

$x/agent/month. No free tier.

Early operations include a human safety layer treated as COGS. As AI handles more, human load shrinks and margins expand without changing the customer story.

## Go to Market

Design partner locked: Every Avenue brokerage. Outbound to team leaders positioning Archie as an alternative to hiring the next assistant.

## Vision

Start with realtors because they represent the hardest user experience test in sales. If Archie can serve them in chaos, it can serve anyone. Win real estate teams, refine the core system, then adapt for solo realtors, mortgage, auto, insurance, and B2B. The long vision: the AI-first alternative to Salesforce for any salesperson on earth.

## Phase 1 Goals

- Ship iPhone agent app plus admin Dispatch console for internal team.
- Core workflows: listing intake, client updates, transaction tasking, vendor coordination.
- Prove reliability with Every Avenue.
- At least a dozen teams live and paying.

## What Comes Next

**Vertical expansion.** The building blocks we create for real estate—"schedule vendor," "prepare contract from template," "update records from conversation"—are the same primitives every salesperson needs. Mortgage brokers, auto dealers, insurance agents: same chaos, same interface, different domain vocabulary.

**The kit system.** As the core stabilizes, we expose these primitives as a developer kit. Third parties define new tools that plug into Archie, but we control the UX and interaction patterns. This mirrors the early Apple model: strict interface guidelines paired with powerful developer access. Archie becomes the controlled ecosystem where sales tools live, not another integration mess.

**The endgame.** A world where ArchieOS is the backbone of sales work across industries. The invisible operating system professionals rely on every day. Speak, see drafts, tap yes. The new default.
