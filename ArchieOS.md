AI Operating System for Real Estate Teams

**Tagline draft:**

The AI operating system that runs your entire back office from a voice memo.

## Philosophy: The 326 Standard

In the late 90s, golfers argued that a 330-gram putter head was the physics-based standard for stability. Tiger Woods didn't care about the physics; he cared about the truth. He applied lead tape, tested, and scraped it off until the tool disappeared in his hands. He found the magic at **326 grams**—a number the industry called an error, but he called perfection.

The software industry builds 330-gram tools—Salesforce, HubSpot, Asana. They are built on "standards". We are rejecting the standard spec sheet. We are building for the specific, undocumented nuance of the high-performance real estate agent that feels like an extension of themselves.

# **One line and narrative**

### One line pitch

Archie is an AI operating system that turns a realtors voice memos into a fully handled transaction: listings drafted, contracts prepared, tasks distributed, reminders set, and follow ups queued, with a human grade safety layer on top.

### Narrative

Salesforce and HubSpot were built for a different era. They are databases with workflows bolted on, optimized for admins, not for the person in the car racing between showings. They keep trying to bolt AI onto that old chassis. It is like dropping a Ferrari engine into a twenty year old Honda. The frame wasn’t built for it.

Real estate agents, especially top producers, are the stress test for any sales system that claims to automate work. They are often non technical, always on the move, juggling a thousand tiny things, and they hate CRMs. If you can build an interface simple enough for an ex stripper/bartender driving a Mercedes at highway speed while negotiating a million dollar deal, you have not just built a tool for realtors. You have built the future of sales software for everyone.

Archie starts there. First we build the operating system that runs the entire back office for high performing real estate teams. Then we reuse the same core pieces for every other type of salesperson who lives in chaos.

# **Problem**

### **At the industry level**

- In the United States there are roughly 3 million active real estate licenses and more than 1.5 million Realtors, members of NAR.
- In Canada there are over 140 thousand real estate brokers, agents and salespeople.
- A minority of these agents close the majority of transactions. The top producers drown in work.

For top teams the pain is not lack of leads. It is death by a thousand cuts on the back office side:

- Endless small admin tasks and compliance steps.
- Fragmented tools for CRM, e-signature, calendars, showing booking, marketing, transaction coordination.
- Reliance on overworked human assistants who are hard to hire, hard to train, and often underperforming.

For brokerages, especially team centric ones, operations look like a human message bus: agents DM admins in Slack or text, admins chase missing pieces, everyone lives in threads.

### **Why CRMs fail this segment**

- CRMs are built around forms, fields and pipelines, not conversations.
- They assume a user who sits at a desk and cares about data hygiene.
- Real estate team leaders and producers are often non technical, often from blue collar or service backgrounds, and optimizers of relationships, not software.

The result: tools like Salesforce, HubSpot and Follow Up Boss are either ignored or weaponized as a chore at the end of the day. The system might be powerful on paper. In practice, very little is kept up to date and almost nothing is automated.

# **Vision**

## The Invisible Backend

ArchieOS is not a website you log into; it is a system you lean on. It is the operations layer that turns unstructured intent, text, a voice note, a forwarded email, into structured, completed action.

### Short Vision

- ArchieOS is the invisible operating system for sales, not something you log into, but something you lean on.
- It's a proactive layer that turns unstructured intent into structured, completed action: text, voice, forwarded email, anything.
- The goal is to take the agent who spends most of their time as a task manager and admin and return them to being the Rainmaker they always wanted to be.
- The result is a feeling of real relief—you put your phone back in your pocket and know the work is getting done.
- Build the AI operating system that runs the entire back office for any salesperson in the world, beginning with real estate teams where speed, complexity and constant motion form the ultimate proving ground.

### Long Vision

- Start with realtors because they represent the hardest user experience test in sales, which is why software fails them currently, if ArchieOS can serve them in the middle of their chaos, it can serve anyone.
- Win the teams that drive the real volume in the industry and use those relationships to refine the core system into a set of AI and user experience building blocks.
- Adapt these building blocks for other sales verticals like mortgage, auto, insurance and high touch B2B same intelligence, same engine, flexible presentation on top.
- As the system matures, shape it into an ecosystem similar to the early Apple developer world: a controlled and beautifully consistent interface where third parties can plug in tools while the core experience stays protected, unified and unmistakably ours.
- The long vision is a world where ArchieOS becomes the backbone of sales work across industries, the invisible operating system professionals rely on every day.

# **What Archie is**

### Archie is:

- An AI operating system for sales teams that lives primarily on a phone app.
- A single interface where agents talk to the system, approve and modify drafts, and see what is happening.
- A back office dispatch console for admins where incoming work is triaged, handled by AI, and escalated to humans as needed that lives primarily on a computer app.
- A CRM like memory layer that keeps track of people, deals, tasks, documents and timelines, but is not presented as a traditional CRM.

### Archie is not:

- Just a CRM. The CRM is one module inside the operating system, like the steering wheel in a car. You buy the car, not the steering wheel.
- A chatbot. Conversation is one input mode, not the product.
- A lead generation service. Archie assumes the teams already have deals and focuses on execution.

# **Core product v1**

### **Primary user**

Initial primary user: team leader of a North American real estate team with roughly 5 to 25 agents, doing on the order of 50 to 300 transactions per year. And all their agents. They either already employ at least one admin or are on the verge of needing one.

This person:

- Spends most of their time in their car or on their phone.
- Feels that tasks are slipping through the cracks.
- Either hates managing an assistant or is avoiding hiring one.

### **Agent app experience**

**Platform**

- iPhone first.
- Simple companion views for iPad and Mac, largely reusing the same components.

**Home screen**

- A big button to touch to start a voice recording and a text input field
- A short list of Drafts to review: contracts, listings, client messages, key tasks.
- A Today strip with the most important commitments and showings.
- A Recent activity feed showing things the system has done or scheduled.

## Magic moment flow

### Voice memo to done

Context: Realtor just hung up a call with a seller while sitting in the car.

1. They open Archie or tap a Shortcut and speak for 30 to 60 seconds, exactly as they would in a raw voice memo.
2. Archie transcribes, understands who this is about, and infers what needs to happen.
3. Within seconds the app shows a preview like:
    - New listing draft created.
    - Photographer outreach prepared.
    - Seller update email drafted.
    - Tasks for staging in progress.
    - MLS data entry form ready to be sent at on click approval.
4. Items that are safe to run automatically, like pinging an approved photographer, can be auto executed. Others appear under Drafts waiting for tap to approve, edit or reject.
5. The realtor can manage everything with large, Kindergarten level controls: big Yes, No, Edit buttons, nothing dense or technical.

### **Dispatch console**

**Working name: Dispatch.**

Audience: admins and human back office operators.

**Responsibilities:**

- See the stream of incoming work from agents.
- View the agent’s transcript and the AI’s proposed actions.
- Approve, modify or override actions and drafts.
- Handle edge cases that the AI is not yet trusted to handle.
- Maintain SLAs for tasks such as booking vendors, checking compliance items, and preparing complex documents.

**Dispatch initially can be built as:**

- A focused app with a queue, search and detail pane.
- Some early work may still run through Slack, but the goal is to move quickly into a first party console.

# **Data model and CRM layer**

**Internally Archie maintains structured records for:**

- Contacts: clients, vendors, partners, with context like birthdays, family details and preferences surfaced automatically from conversations.
- Deals and listings: status, price, key dates, contingencies, documents.
- Tasks: atomic units of work that can be assigned to admin, agent, or AI.
- Messages: emails, texts, internal comments, and transcripts associated with the above.

**Externally, rather than forcing agents into a traditional CRM UI, Archie:**

- Uses the phone’s contacts as the anchor where possible.
- Shows deal and task context around people, not inside deep tables and pipeline views.
- Can sync to or mirror a team CRM later for teams that require it.

# **Target customers and market**

### **Initial ICP**

- Geography: United States and Canada.
- Segment: top performing real estate teams and boutique brokerages who run teams inside larger franchises.
- Team size: roughly 5 to 25 producing agents.
- Behavior: high transaction volume, overwhelmed by operations, not price shoppers.

### **Excluded customers at first**

- Very large enterprise brokerages where centralized IT and legacy systems would bog down early product work.
- Independent agents who do high volume

### **Excluded customers always**

- Solo low volume agents hunting for free tools and leads.
- Lead gen obsessed groups that want more leads rather than better execution. Archie does not sell leads.

### **Market size snapshot**

- United States: around 3 million active real estate licenses, with more than 1.5 million Realtors as of mid 2024.
- Canada: at least 140 thousand agents and brokers.
- Thousands of teams fall into the 5 to 25 agent band with meaningful volume on both sides of the border. Even serving a tiny fraction of the top twenty percent of agents is a substantial software business.

# **Business model**

**Buyer**

- Primary buyer: the team leader or team owner.
- They put in the credit card and manage seats.
- Brokerages like Every Avenue can act as channel partners and design partners.

**Pricing**

Working assumption for the doc:

- Per seat subscription.
- Starting around 200 USD per producing agent per month, with volume discounts at team level.
- No free tier. Short trial or pilot periods maybe can be offered, but this is a paid product only.

**Economics and human layer**

- The partner brokerage, Every Avenue, today runs roughly a 1 to 9 admin to agent ratio and would break even at around 1 to 20.
- Every Avenue has agreed to let us use and build on their admin team for early stages.
- Archie aims to let teams operate as if they have a best in class assistant at a fraction of the cost by mixing AI and a centralized human service.
- The human in the loop costs are treated as COGS early on. Over time automation reduces the human load, improving margins without changing the customer story.

# **Go to market**

**Design partner**

- Every Avenue is the first design and pilot partner.
- Founder Duncan receives a vesting equity stake in Archie in recognition of the deep access to their systems, data, and feedback.

**Initial motion**

- Deploy Archie inside Every Avenue teams.
- Manually onboard a handful of additional teams where the founder has direct relationships.
- Use these teams to refine workflows, SLAs, and pricing.

**Outbound motion**

- Build a narrative landing page speaking directly to team leaders who feel like they are drowning in admin work.
- Run targeted outbound campaigns to team leaders in the United States and Canada sending them to book demos.
- Position Archie as an alternative to hiring the next assistant, not as another software subscription.

**Story for talent and investors**

The internal and recruiting story is not about real estate. Real estate is the stress test. The story is:

- Salesforce and its peers are part of the collective cognitive load of humanity. They sit between people and the work they actually want to do.
- Archie's mission is to redesign that layer from first principles for the AI era, starting with the segment that feels the pain the most.
- If Archie can build an interface and operating system that real estate teams love using, that same system can be generalized to any salesperson on earth.

# **Technology and architecture**

**High level approach:**

- One primary ai agent that orchestrates work, backed by a set of specialized internal agents for tasks like document generation, reminder planning, vendor booking, and compliance checking.
- Voice memo input supported from day one: audio captured on device, transcribed, and fed into the system.
- Text input supported inside the app for quick corrections and manual input.
- Initial integrations limited and opinionated to reduce surface area. Over time, add deep integrations with email, calendar, e-signature platforms, MLS systems and vendor networks.

### **Future platform and kit system**

**Longer term vision:**

- Take the repeated building blocks from real estate, such as “schedule vendor”, “prepare contract from template”, “update CRM like record from conversation”, and expose them as a kit system.
- Third parties can define new tools that plug into Archie much like MCP style connectors, but Archie controls the UX and interaction patterns.
- This mirrors the Apple pattern of strict UX guidelines paired with powerful developer kits.

# **Human in the loop operations**

**Early stage model:**

- A small human operations team works inside Dispatch, reviewing AI suggestions, handling special cases, and doing work that is not yet automated.
- Tasks routed to humans include ambiguous vendor coordination, complex contract edge cases, and anything the AI flags as low confidence.
- Target response times: initial assumption of under one business hour for most tasks during working hours, improving as the system matures.
- Over time, learning from repeated human actions informs automation, shrinking the human workload.

# **Roadmap**

**Phase 1 - Real estate teams v1**

- Build and ship iPhone agent app plus Dispatch console.
- Support the core workflows: listing intake, client updates, transaction tasking, vendor coordination.
- Prove that Every Avenue can reliably run deals through Archie with high satisfaction.
- Achieve at least a dozen teams live and paying.

**Phase 2 - Broader realtor adoption**

- Expand to more teams at other brokerages in the US and Canada.
- Add deeper email, calendar, and document integrations.
- Templatize onboarding so a new team can go live in days, not weeks.

**Phase 3 - Expand within real estate or Second vertical**

- Reuse the same operating system and UX primitives to support another sales vertical, probably mortgage or auto.
- Adapt domain specific templates, vocabularies, and compliance rules, while keeping the interface nearly identical.
- Begin articulating Archie as the horizontal operating system for sales, with multiple vertical skins.

**Phase 4 - Salesforce killer**

- Mature developer kits and extension system.
- Position Archie as the AI first alternative to Salesforce and HubSpot for new teams and modern organizations.
- Long term success looks like:
    - A large community of teams and developers building on Archie.
    - A new default way people expect to interact with work systems: speak, see drafts, tap yes.
