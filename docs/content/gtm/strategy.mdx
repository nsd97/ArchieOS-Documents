# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Design Partner

- Every Avenue is the first design and pilot partner.
- Founder Duncan receives a vesting equity stake in Archie in recognition of the deep access to their systems, data, and feedback.

## Initial Motion

- Deploy Archie inside Every Avenue teams.
- Manually onboard a handful of additional teams where the founder has direct relationships.
- Use these teams to refine workflows, SLAs, and pricing.

## Outbound Motion

- Build a narrative landing page speaking directly to team leaders who feel like they are drowning in admin work.
- Run targeted outbound campaigns to team leaders in the United States and Canada sending them to book demos.
- Position Archie as an alternative to hiring the next assistant, not as another software subscription.

## Business Model

### Buyer

- Primary buyer: the team leader or team owner.
- They put in the credit card and manage seats.
- Brokerages like Every Avenue can act as channel partners and design partners.

### Pricing

Working assumption:

- Per seat subscription.
- Starting around 200 USD per producing agent per month, with volume discounts at team level.
- No free tier. Short trial or pilot periods maybe can be offered, but this is a paid product only.

### Economics and Human Layer

- The partner brokerage, Every Avenue, today runs roughly a 1 to 9 admin to agent ratio and would break even at around 1 to 20.
- Every Avenue has agreed to let us use and build on their admin team for early stages.
- Archie aims to let teams operate as if they have a best in class assistant at a fraction of the cost by mixing AI and a centralized human service.
- The human in the loop costs are treated as COGS early on. Over time automation reduces the human load, improving margins without changing the customer story.
