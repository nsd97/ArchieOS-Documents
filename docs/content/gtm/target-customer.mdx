# Target Customers and Market

## Initial ICP

- **Geography:** United States and Canada.
- **Segment:** top performing real estate teams and boutique brokerages who run teams inside larger franchises.
- **Team size:** roughly 5 to 25 producing agents.
- **Behavior:** high transaction volume, overwhelmed by operations, not price shoppers.

## Excluded Customers at First

- Very large enterprise brokerages where centralized IT and legacy systems would bog down early product work.
- Independent agents who do high volume (may be addressed later)

## Excluded Customers Always

- Solo low volume agents hunting for free tools and leads.
- Lead gen obsessed groups that want more leads rather than better execution. Archie does not sell leads.

## Market Size Snapshot

- **United States:** around 3 million active real estate licenses, with more than 1.5 million Realtors as of mid 2024.
- **Canada:** at least 140 thousand agents and brokers.
- Thousands of teams fall into the 5 to 25 agent band with meaningful volume on both sides of the border. Even serving a tiny fraction of the top twenty percent of agents is a substantial software business.
