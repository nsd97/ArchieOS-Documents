# Data Model and CRM Layer

## Internal Records

Internally Archie maintains structured records for:

- **Contacts:** clients, vendors, partners, with context like birthdays, family details and preferences surfaced automatically from conversations.
- **Deals and listings:** status, price, key dates, contingencies, documents.
- **Tasks:** atomic units of work that can be assigned to admin, agent, or AI.
- **Messages:** emails, texts, internal comments, and transcripts associated with the above.

## External Presentation

Rather than forcing agents into a traditional CRM UI, Archie:

- Uses the phone's contacts as the anchor where possible.
- Shows deal and task context around people, not inside deep tables and pipeline views.
- Can sync to or mirror a team CRM later for teams that require it.

## Design Philosophy

The CRM is one module inside the operating system, like the steering wheel in a car. You buy the car, not the steering wheel.

Data hygiene happens automatically through conversation extraction—agents don't need to manually update records because Archie infers changes from voice memos and messages.
