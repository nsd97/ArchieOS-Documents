# Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Real Estate Teams v1

- Build and ship iPhone agent app plus Dispatch console.
- Support the core workflows: listing intake, client updates, transaction tasking, vendor coordination.
- Prove that Every Avenue can reliably run deals through Archie with high satisfaction.
- Achieve at least a dozen teams live and paying.

## Phase 2 - Broader Realtor Adoption

- Expand to more teams at other brokerages in the US and Canada.
- Add deeper email, calendar, and document integrations.
- Templatize onboarding so a new team can go live in days, not weeks.

## Phase 3 - Expand Within Real Estate or Second Vertical

- Reuse the same operating system and UX primitives to support another sales vertical, probably mortgage or auto.
- Adapt domain specific templates, vocabularies, and compliance rules, while keeping the interface nearly identical.
- Begin articulating Archie as the horizontal operating system for sales, with multiple vertical skins.

## Phase 4 - Salesforce Killer

- Mature developer kits and extension system.
- Position Archie as the AI first alternative to Salesforce and HubSpot for new teams and modern organizations.
- Long term success looks like:
    - A large community of teams and developers building on Archie.
    - A new default way people expect to interact with work systems: speak, see drafts, tap yes.
